# GraphGAN-The-new-way-to-learn-graph-
GraphGAN combines graph-based methods with GANs, utilizing a generator to create fake graph data and a discriminator to evaluate its authenticity. It's useful for graph generation, link prediction, and node classification, with applications in social networks and recommendation systems.
